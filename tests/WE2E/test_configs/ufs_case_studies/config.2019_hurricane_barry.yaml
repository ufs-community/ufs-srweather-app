    This test is to ensure that the workflow running in community mode
    completes successfully on the RRFS_CONUS_13km grid using the FV3_GFS_v16
    physics suite with ICs and LBCs derived from the UFS-CASE-STUDIES platforms 
    for 2019 Hurricane Barry.
    # NOTE: FCST_LEN_HRS is set to 6 because it can take a very long time to
    #       download these files, which can delay the WE2E testing process.
    #       To capture the event, extend the FCST_LEN_HRS from 6 to 90.
