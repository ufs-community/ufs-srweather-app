    This test checks the capability of the workflow to have the character
    (DOT_OR_USCORE) in the names of the input grid and orography files
    that comes after the C-resolution be set to a user-specified value.
    For example, a grid file may be named
      C403${DOT_OR_USCORE}grid.tile7.halo4.nc
    where "C403" is the C-resolution for this specific grid and
    ${DOT_OR_USCORE} represents the contents of the workflow variable
    DOT_OR_USCORE (bash syntax).  DOT_OR_USCORE is by default set to an
    underscore, but for consistency with the rest of the separators in the
    file name (as well as with the character after the C-resolution in the
    names of the surface climatology files), it should be a "." (a dot).
    The MAKE_GRID_TN and MAKE_OROG_TN tasks will name the grid and orography
    files that they create using this character.
