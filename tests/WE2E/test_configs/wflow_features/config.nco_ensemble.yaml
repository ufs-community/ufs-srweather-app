    This test checks the capability of the workflow to run ensemble forecasts
    (i.e. DO_ENSEMBLE set to "TRUE") in nco mode (i.e. RUN_ENVIR set to
    "nco") with the number of ensemble members (NUM_ENS_MEMBERS) set to
    "2".  The lack of leading zeros in this "2" should cause the ensemble
    members to be named "mem1" and "mem2" (instead of, for instance, "mem01"
    and "mem02").
    Note also that this test uses two cycle hours ("12" and "18") to test
    the capability of the workflow to run ensemble forecasts for more than
    one cycle hour in nco mode.
