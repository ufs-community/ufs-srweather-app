    SRW App configuration file to first pull CCPA, NOHRSC, MRMS, and NDAS
    observations from HPSS for a single cycle with a relatively long forecast
    (36 hours) cycle and then perform deterministic verification, including
    first performing vx preprocessing with METplus tools such as PcpCombine
    and Pb2Nc.

    The staged forecast data are from the SRW itself.

    This test uses a winter case to ensure that ASNOW is verified correctly
    for both 6-hour and 24-hour accumulations.
