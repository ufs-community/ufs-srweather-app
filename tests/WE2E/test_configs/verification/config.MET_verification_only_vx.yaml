    This test is to ensure that the workflow running in community mode
    can successfully run the MET deterministic verification tasks but
    using staged observation and forecast files (i.e. with other tasks
    such as pre-processing, forecast, and post-processing deactivated).

# This test assumes that the post-processed forecast files are staged
# (i.e., not generated by running the forecast model).
# It also assumes staged observations, so turn off those tasks.
