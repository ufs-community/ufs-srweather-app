To build and run the UFS Short-Range Weather Application, the user must get the workflow scripts,
and source code for the UFS_UTILS pre-processor, the UFS Weather Model, and the Unified
Post Processor (UPP).  Obtaining the source code is simplified by the use of *manage_externals*,
which allows the user to clone an umbrella repository and all of the necessary sub-repositories.
The steps described in this chapter assume that the necessary software/operating system
requirements and libraries described in :numref:`Section %s <SystemRequirements>` are built
and available as modules on your machine.
