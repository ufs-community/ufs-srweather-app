# Simple setup instructions for the UFS SRW App 
# For more details, see the "Getting Started" guide:
# https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/wiki/Getting-Started

# Getting the UFS SRW App code
#
# The SRW App can be downloaded directly from github, either by using `git clone` or by downloading
# from the web.

git clone https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app.git

cd ufs-srweather-app/
./manage_externals/checkout_externals

# Prior to building, you must set up the environment so cmake can find the appropriate compilers
# and libraries. For instructions specific to supported platforms, see the "build_[machine]_[compiler].env 
# files in the "env" directory. These files give instructions assuming a bash or ksh login shell, for
# csh and tcsh users you will have to modify the commands for setting envronment variables.

# Supported CMake flags:
#  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX Location where the bin/ include/ lib/ and share/ directories containing
#                         the various components of the SRW App will be created. Recommended value
#                         is "..", one directory up from the build directory
#  -DCCPP_SUITES          A comma-separated list of CCPP suites to build with the UFS weather 
#                         model. See the User's Guide for a full list of available suites. The 
#                         default is to build with the released supported suites: FV3_GFS_v15p2 and
#                         FV3_RRFS_v1beta

mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=..
make -j 8
