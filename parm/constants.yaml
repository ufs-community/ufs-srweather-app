  # Any regional model must be supplied lateral boundary conditions (in
  # addition to initial conditions) to be able to perform a forecast.  In
  # the FV3-LAM model, these boundary conditions (BCs) are supplied using
  # a "halo" of grid cells around the regional domain that extend beyond
  # the boundary of the domain.  The model is formulated such that along
  # with files containing these BCs, it needs as input the following files
  # (in NetCDF format):
  #
  # 1) A grid file that includes a halo of 3 cells beyond the boundary of
  #    the domain.
  # 2) A grid file that includes a halo of 4 cells beyond the boundary of
  #    the domain.
  # 3) A (filtered) orography file without a halo, i.e. a halo of width
  #    0 cells.
  # 4) A (filtered) orography file that includes a halo of 4 cells beyond
  #    the boundary of the domain.
  #
  # Note that the regional grid is referred to as "tile 7" in the code.
  # Therefore, we will set the constants to a regional, tile 7 with
  # these config options:
  #
  # GTYPE:
  # Grid type string, set to regional for SRW
