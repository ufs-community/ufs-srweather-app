#
# This configuration file specifies the field groups, fields, levels,
# and thresholds to use for DETERMINISTIC verification.  The format is
# as follows:
#
# FIELD_GROUP1:
#     FIELD1:
#         LEVEL1: list_of_thresholds
#         LEVEL2: list_of_thresholds
#         ...
#     FIELD2:
#         LEVEL1: list_of_thresholds
#         LEVEL2: list_of_thresholds
#         ...
#     ...
#             
# FIELD_GROUP2:
#     FIELD1:
#         LEVEL1: list_of_thresholds
#         LEVEL2: list_of_thresholds
#         ...
#     FIELD2:
#         LEVEL1: list_of_thresholds
#         LEVEL2: list_of_thresholds
#         ...
#     ...
#
#  ...
#
# If the threshold list for a given combination of field group, field,
# and level is set to the empty string ([]), then all values of that
# field will be included in the verification.
#
# Both the keys that represent field groups, fields, and levels and the
# strings in the list of thresholds may contain the separator string "%%"
# that separates the value of the quantity for the forecast from that for
# the observations.  For example, if a field is set to
#
#   RETOP%%EchoTop18
#
# it means the name of the field in the forecast data is RETOP while its
# name in the observations is EchoTop18.
