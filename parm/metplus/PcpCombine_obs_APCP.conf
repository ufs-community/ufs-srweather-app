# In general, we want to recreate the files when the SRW App workflow
# task that uses this METplus configuration file is relaunched.  In this
# case, however, it is necessary to skip the call to PcpCombine because
# in the SRW App's workflow, more than one cycle may want to create the
# same file.  This can happen if the forecast periods from two or more
# forecasts overlap, e.g. forecast 1 starts at 00Z of day one and forecast
# 2 starts at 00Z of day 2, and the forecasts are both 36 hours long, so
# the last 12 hours of forecast 1 overlap with the first 12 hours of
# forecast 2.  In this case, there will be two workflow tasks that will
# try to create the observation APCP files for those 12 hours, and the
# files will be named exactly the same (because the output naming convention
# in this conf file uses valid times).  In order to (1) avoid duplicating
# work and (2) having two tasks accidentally trying to write to the same
# file (which will cause at least one task to fail), we do not call 
# PcpCombine if the output file (for a given forecast hour) already
