    Default configuration for an experiment. The valid values for most of the
    parameters are specified in valid_param_vals.yaml
###
# USER-related configuration parameters
#
user:

  ###
  # (Default: ``"nco"``)
  # 
  # This variable determines the workflow mode. The user can choose between two options: "nco" and "community". The "nco" mode uses a directory structure that mimics what is used in operations at NOAA/NCEP Central Operations (NCO) and at the NOAA/NCEP/Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), which works with NCO on pre-implementation testing. Specifics of the conventions used in "nco" mode can be found in the following :nco:`WCOSS Implementation Standards <>` document:
  #
  #   | NCEP Central Operations
  #   | WCOSS Implementation Standards
  #   | January 19, 2022
  #   | Version 11.0.0
  #
  # Setting ``RUN_ENVIR`` to "community" is recommended in most cases for users who are not running in NCO's production environment. Valid values: ``"nco"`` | ``"community"``
  #
  RUN_ENVIR: "nco"

  # Set machine and queue parameters.  Definitions:
  #
  # MACHINE:
  # Machine on which the workflow will run. If you are NOT on a named,
  # supported platform, and you want to use the Rocoto workflow manager,
  # you will need set MACHINE: "linux" and WORKFLOW_MANAGER: "rocoto". This
  # combination will assume a Slurm batch manager when generating the XML.
  # Please see ush/valid_param_vals.yaml for a full list of supported
  # platforms.
  #
  # ACCOUNT:
  # The account under which to submit jobs to the queue.
  #
  # HOMEdir: 
  # The path to the user's ufs-srweather-app clone. This path 
  # is set in ush/setup.py as the parent directory to USHdir. 
  #
  # USHdir: 
  # The path to the user's ush directory in their ufs-srweather-app clone. 
  # This path is set automatically in the main function of setup.py and 
  # corresponds to the location of setup.py (i.e., the ush directory).
  # 
  # SCRIPTSdir: 
  # The path to the user's scripts directory in their ufs-srweather-app clone.
  # 
  # JOBSdir: 
  # The path to the user's jobs directory in their ufs-srweather-app clone.

  # MODULESdir: 
  # The path to the user's modulefiles directory in their ufs-srweather-app 
  # clone.
  # 
  # EXECdir: 
  # The path to the user's exec directory in their ufs-srweather-app clone.
  #
  # METPLUS_CONF: 
  # The path to the user's final METplus configuration file. By default, 
  # METplus configuration files reside in ufs-srweather-app/parm/metplus.
  #  
  # UFS_WTHR_MDL_DIR: 
  # The path to the location where the weather 
  # model code is located within the ufs-srweather-app clone. This 
  # parameter is set in setup.py and uses information from the 
  # Externals.cfg file to build the correct path. It is built with 
  # knowledge of HOMEdir and often corresponds to ufs-srweather-app/
  # sorc/ufs-weather-model.
  # 
  # ARL_NEXUS_DIR: 
  # The path to the user's NEXUS directory. By default, NEXUS source 
  # code resides in ufs-srweather-app/sorc/arl_nexus

# PLATFORM config parameters
#-----------------------------
platform:
  #
  #-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # WORKFLOW_MANAGER:
  # The workflow manager to use (e.g., rocoto). This is set to "none" by
  # default, but if the machine name is set to a platform that supports
  # Rocoto, this will be overwritten and set to "rocoto". If set
  # explicitly to "rocoto" along with the use of the MACHINE: "linux" target,
  # the configuration layer assumes a Slurm batch manager when generating
  # the XML. Valid options: "rocoto" or "none"
  #
  # NCORES_PER_NODE:
  # The number of cores available per node on the compute platform, now 
  # configurable for all platforms.

  # machine.
  #
  # PARTITION_DEFAULT:
  # If using the slurm job scheduler (i.e. if SCHED is set to "slurm"), 
  # the default partition to which to submit workflow tasks.  If a task 
  # does not have a specific variable that specifies the partition to which 
  # it will be submitted (e.g. PARTITION_HPSS, PARTITION_FCST; see below), 
  # it will be submitted to the partition specified by this variable.  If 
  # this is not set or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a 
  # machine-dependent value.  This is not used if SCHED is not set to 
  # "slurm".
  #
  # QUEUE_DEFAULT:
  # The default queue or QOS (if using the slurm job scheduler, where QOS
  # is Quality of Service) to which workflow tasks are submitted.  If a 
  # task does not have a specific variable that specifies the queue to which

  # be submitted to the queue specified by this variable.  If this is not 
  # set or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-
  # dependent value.
  #
  # PARTITION_HPSS:
  # If using the slurm job scheduler (i.e. if SCHED is set to "slurm"), 
  # Tasks that get or create links to external 
  # model files [which are needed to generate initial conditions (ICs) and 
  # lateral boundary conditions (LBCs)] are submitted to this partition.  If this is not set 
  # or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent 
  # value.  This is not used if SCHED is not set to "slurm".
  #
  # QUEUE_HPSS:
  # Tasks that get or create links to external 
  # model files [which are needed to generate initial conditions (ICs) and 
  # lateral boundary conditions (LBCs)] are submitted to this queue or QOS.  If this is not set 
  # or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent 
  # value.
  #
  # PARTITION_FCST:
  # If using the slurm job scheduler (i.e. if SCHED is set to "slurm"), 
  # The task that runs forecasts is submitted to this partition.  If 
  # this is not set or set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a 
  # machine-dependent value.  This is not used if SCHED is not set to 
  # "slurm".
  #
  # QUEUE_FCST:
  # The task that runs a forecast is submitted to this queue or QOS.  
  # If this is not set or set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a 
  # machine-dependent value.
  #
  # REMOVE_MEMORY:
  # Boolean flag determining whether to remove the memory flag for the
  # Rocoto XML. Some platforms are not configured to accept the memory
  # flag, so must not be included at all in the XML.

  # Set GRID_GEN_METHOD. This variable specifies the method to use to 
  # generate a regional grid in the horizontal. The values that it can 
  # take on are:
  #
  # * "ESGgrid":
  #   This will generate a regional grid using the map projection developed
  #   by Jim Purser of EMC.
  #
  # * "GFDLgrid":
  #   The "GFDLgrid" method first generates a "parent" global cubed-sphere grid. a 
  #   Then a portion from tile 6 of the global grid is used as the regional grid. 
  #   This regional grid is referred to in the grid generation scripts 
  #   as "tile 7," even though it does not correspond to a complete tile.
  #   The forecast is run only on the regional grid (i.e., on tile 7, not on tiles 1 through 6). 
  #
  # Note that:
  #
  # 1) If the experiment uses a predefined grid (i.e. if 
  #    PREDEF_GRID_NAME is set to the name of a valid predefined 
  #    grid), then GRID_GEN_METHOD will be reset to the value of 
  #    GRID_GEN_METHOD for that grid.  This will happen regardless of 
  #    whether GRID_GEN_METHOD is assigned a value in the user-
  #    specified experiment configuration file. In other words, any value 
  #    assigned in the experiment configuration file will be overwritten.
  #
  # 2) If the experiment is not using one of the predefined grids (i.e. if 
  #    PREDEF_GRID_NAME is set to a null string), then GRID_GEN_METHOD must 
  #    be set in the experiment configuration file.  Otherwise, 
  #    the experiment generation will fail because the generation 
  #    scripts check to ensure that the grid name is set to a non-empty 
  #    string before creating the experiment directory.

  # parameters are specified in the script 
  #
  #   $HOMEdir/ush/set_predef_grid_params.py
  #
  # * If PREDEF_GRID_NAME is set to a valid predefined grid name, the grid 
  #   generation method GRID_GEN_METHOD, the (native) grid parameters, and 
  #   the write-component grid parameters are set to predefined values for 
  #   the specified grid, overwriting any settings of these parameters in 
  #   the user-specified experiment configuration file.  In addition, if 
  #   the time step DT_ATMOS and the computational parameters LAYOUT_X, 
  #   LAYOUT_Y, and BLOCKSIZE are not specified in that configuration file, 
  #   they are also set to predefined values for the specified grid.
  #
  # * If PREDEF_GRID_NAME is set to an empty string, it implies the user
  #   will provide the native grid parameters in the user-specified 
  #   experiment configuration file (EXPT_CONFIG_FN). In this case, the 
  #   grid generation method GRID_GEN_METHOD, the native grid parameters, 
  #   the write-component grid parameters, the forecast model's 
  # main time step DT_ATMOS, and the computational 
  #   parameters (LAYOUT_X, LAYOUT_Y, and BLOCKSIZE) must be set in that

  # INCR_CYCL_FREQ:

  # FCST_LEN_HRS:
  # The length of each forecast, in integer hours. The short forecast
  # length when there are different lengths.

  # LONG_FCST_LEN_HRS:

  # directly, as it is derived from FCST_LEN_CYCL when FCST_LEN_HRS=-1

  # to deal with preexisting directories [e.g., ones generated by previous
  # calls to the experiment generation script using the same experiment name
  # (EXPT_SUBDIR) as the current experiment].  This variable must be set to
  # "delete", "reuse", "rename", or "quit". The resulting behavior for each
  # of these values is as follows:
  #
  # * "delete":
  #   The preexisting directory is deleted and a new directory (having the
  #   same name as the original preexisting directory) is created.
  #
  # * "rename":
  #   The preexisting directory is renamed and a new directory (having the
  #   same name as the original preexisting directory) is created. The new
  #   name of the preexisting directory consists of its original name and
  #   the suffix "_oldNNN", where NNN is a 3-digit integer chosen to make
  #   the new name unique.
  #
  # * "reuse":
  #    This method will keep preexisting directory intact except that
  #     when preexisting directory is $EXPDIR, do the following:
  #       save all old files to a subdirectory oldxxx/ and then
  #       populate new files into the $EXPDIR directory
  #    This is useful to keep ongoing runs uninterrupted:
  #     rocotoco *db files and previous cycles will stay and hence
  #       1. no need to manually cp/mv *db files and previous cycles back
  #       2. no need to manually restart related rocoto tasks failed during
  #            the workflow generation process
  #    This may be best suited for incremental system reuses.
  #
  # * "quit":
  #   The preexisting directory is left unchanged, but execution of the
  #   currently running script is terminated.  In this case, the preexisting
  #   directory must be dealt with manually before rerunning the script.

  #
  # The forecast model requires grid files containing 3-cell- and

  # the grid and orography tasks create preliminary files with halos around the regional domain
  # of width ESGgrid_WIDE_HALO_WIDTH cells. 
  # The files are then read in and "shaved" down to obtain grid
  # files with 3-cell-wide and 4-cell-wide halos and orography files with
  # 0-cell-wide (i.e. no halo) and 3-cell-wide halos.  The original halo that
  #  gets shaved down is referred to as the "wide" halo because it is wider than the 0-cell-wide,  
  # 3-cell-wide, and 4-cell-wide halos that users eventually end up with.
  # Note that the grid and orography files with the wide halo are only needed as intermediates

  # For convenience, the regional grid is denoted as "tile 7" even though it
  # is embedded within tile 6 (i.e., it doesn't extend
  #   beyond the boundary of tile 6). Its exact location within tile 6 is
  #   is determined by specifying the starting and ending i and j indices
  #   of the regional grid on tile 6, where i is the grid index in the x
  #   direction and j is the grid index in the y direction.  
  # All of this information is set in the variables below.
  #
  # Definitions of parameters that need to be specified when GRID_GEN_METHOD
  # is set to "GFDLgrid":
  #
  # GFDLgrid_LON_T6_CTR:
  # Longitude of the center of tile 6 (in degrees).
  #
  # GFDLgrid_LAT_T6_CTR:
  # Latitude of the center of tile 6 (in degrees).
  #
  # GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS: The number of grid cells in either one of the two 
  # horizontal directions x and y on any one of the 6 tiles of the parent
  # global cubed-sphere grid.
  # The mapping from GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS to a nominal
  #   resolution (grid cell size) for a uniform global grid (i.e., a grid with Schmidt
  #   stretch factor GFDLgrid_STRETCH_FAC set to 1) for several values of
  #   GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS is as follows:
  #
  #     GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS      typical cell size
  #     ------------      -----------------
  #               48                 200 km
  #               96                 100 km
  #              192                  50 km
  #              384                  25 km
  #              768                  13 km
  #             1152                 8.5 km
  #             3072                 3.2 km
  #
  # * Note that these are only typical cell sizes.  The actual cell size on
  #   the global grid tiles varies somewhat as we move across a tile and is dependent
  # on both GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS and on GFDLgrid_STRETCH_FAC, which 
  # modifies the shape and size of the tile.
  #
  # * Note that the name of this parameter
  #   is really a misnomer because although it has the string "RES" (for 
  #   "resolution") in its name, it specifies number of grid cells, not grid
  #   size (e.g., in meters or kilometers). However, we keep this name in order
  #   to remain consistent with the usage of the word "resolution" in the 
  #   global forecast model and other auxiliary code.
  #
  # GFDLgrid_STRETCH_FAC: 
  # Stretching factor used in the Schmidt transformation 
  # applied to the parent cubed-sphere grid. 
  # Setting the Schmidt stretching factor GFDLgrid_STRETCH_FAC to a value
  # greater than 1 shrinks tile 6, while setting it to a value less than 
  # 1 (but still greater than 0) expands it.  The remaining 5 tiles change
  #   shape as necessary to maintain global coverage of the grid.
  #
  # * GFDLgrid_REFINE_RATIO is the refinement ratio of the regional grid 
  #   (tile 7) with respect to the grid on its parent tile (tile 6), i.e.,
  #   it is the number of grid cells along the boundary of the regional grid
  #   that abut one cell on tile 6.  Thus, the cell size on the regional 
  #   grid depends not only on GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS and GFDLgrid_STRETCH_FAC (because
  #   the cell size on tile 6 depends on these two parameters) but also on 
  #   GFDLgrid_REFINE_RATIO.  Note that as on the tiles of the global grid, 
  #   the cell size on the regional grid is not uniform but varies as we move across the grid.
  #
  # 
  # GFDLgrid_ISTART_OF_RGNL_DOM_ON_T6G:
  # i-index on tile 6 at which the regional grid (tile 7) starts.
  #
  # GFDLgrid_IEND_OF_RGNL_DOM_ON_T6G:
  # i-index on tile 6 at which the regional grid (tile 7) ends.
  #
  # GFDLgrid_JSTART_OF_RGNL_DOM_ON_T6G:
  # j-index on tile 6 at which the regional grid (tile 7) starts.
  #
  # GFDLgrid_JEND_OF_RGNL_DOM_ON_T6G:
  # j-index on tile 6 at which the regional grid (tile 7) ends.
  #
  # GFDLgrid_USE_NUM_CELLS_IN_FILENAMES:
  # Flag that determines the file naming convention to use for grid, orography,
  # and surface climatology files (or, if using pregenerated files, the
  # naming convention that was used to name these files).  These files 
  # usually start with the string "C${RES}_", where RES is an integer.
  # In the global forecast model, RES is the number of points in each of
  # the two horizontal directions (x and y) on each tile of the global grid
  # (defined here as GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS).  If this flag is set to true, RES will
  # be set to GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS just as in the global forecast model.  If it is
  # set to false, we calculate (in the grid generation task) an "equivalent
  # global uniform cubed-sphere resolution" -- call it RES_EQUIV -- and 
  # then set RES equal to it.  RES_EQUIV is the number of grid points in 
  # each of the x and y directions on each tile that a global UNIFORM (i.e., 
  # stretch factor of 1) cubed-sphere grid would have to have in order to
  # have the same average grid size as the regional grid.  This is a more
  # useful indicator of the grid size because it takes into account the 
  # effects of GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS, GFDLgrid_STRETCH_FAC, and GFDLgrid_REFINE_RATIO
  # in determining the regional grid's typical grid size, whereas simply
  # setting RES to GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS doesn't take into account the effects of
  # GFDLgrid_STRETCH_FAC and GFDLgrid_REFINE_RATIO on the regional grid's
  # resolution.  Nevertheless, some users still prefer to use GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS
  # in the file names, so we allow for that here by setting this flag to
  # true.

  # written by the UFS Weather Model use an Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) 
  # component, referred to as the write component. This model component is 
  # configured with settings in the model_configure file, as described in the UFS 
  # Weather Model documentation. 
  #
  # Definitions:
  #
  # QUILTING:
  # Flag that determines whether or not to use the write component for 
  # writing output files to disk. The regional grid requires the use of 
  # the write component, so users should not change the default value. 
  # When set to true, the forecast model will output files named dynf$HHH.nc 
  # and phyf$HHH.nc (where HHH is the 3-digit forecast hour) containing dynamics 
  # and physics fields, respectively, on the write-component grid. 
  # 
  # PRINT_ESMF:
  # Flag that determines whether to output extra (debugging) information from
  # ESMF routines. Must be true or false. Note that the write
  # component uses ESMF library routines to interpolate from the native
  # forecast model grid to the user-specified output grid (which is defined 
  # in the model configuration file "model_configure" in the forecast's  
  # run directory).
  # 
  # WRTCMP_write_groups:
  # The number of write groups (i.e. groups of MPI tasks) to use in the
  # write component.
  #
  # WRTCMP_write_tasks_per_group:
  # The number of MPI tasks to allocate for each write group.
  #
  # WRTCMP_output_grid:
  # Sets the type (coordinate system) of the write component grid. The 
  # default empty string forces the user to set a valid value for 
  # WRTCMP_output_grid in config.yaml if specifying a *custom* grid. When 
  # creating an experiment with a user-defined grid, this parameter must 
  # be specified or the experiment will fail. 
  #
  # WRTCMP_cen_lon:
  # Longitude (in degrees) of the center of the write component grid. Can 
  # usually be set to the corresponding value from the native grid.

  # Latitude (in degrees) of the center of the write component grid. Can 
  # usually be set to the corresponding value from the native grid.
  #
  # WRTCMP_lon_lwr_left:
  # Longitude (in degrees) of the center of the lower-left (southwest) 
  # cell on the write component grid. If using the "rotated_latlon" 
  # coordinate system, this is expressed in terms of the rotated longitude. 
  # Must be set manually when running an experiment with a user-defined grid.
  #
  # WRTCMP_lat_lwr_left:
  # Latitude (in degrees) of the center of the lower-left (southwest) cell
