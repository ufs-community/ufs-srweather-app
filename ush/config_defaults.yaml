  # RUN_ENVIR is described in this document as follows:
  #
  #   Set to "nco" if running in NCO's production environment. Used to 
  #   distinguish between organizations.
  #
  # Valid values are "nco" and "community".  Here, we use it to generate
  # and run the experiment either in NCO mode (if RUN_ENVIR is set to "nco")
  # or in community mode (if RUN_ENVIR is set to "community").  This has 
  # implications on the experiment variables that need to be set and the
  # the directory structure used.

# PLATFORM config parameters
#-----------------------------
platform:
  #
  #-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # WORKFLOW_MANAGER:
  # The workflow manager to use (e.g. rocoto). This is set to "none" by
  # default, but if the machine name is set to a platform that supports
  # rocoto, this will be overwritten and set to "rocoto". If set
  # explicitly to rocoto along with the use of the MACHINE=linux target,
  # the configuration layer assumes a Slurm batch manager when generating
  # the XML. Valid options: "rocoto" or "none"
  #
  # NCORES_PER_NODE:
  # The number of cores available per node on the compute platform, now 
  # configurable for all platforms.
  #
  # TASKTHROTTLE:
  # The number of active tasks run simultaneously. For linux/mac setting this
  # to 1 makes sense
  #
  # BUILD_MOD_FN:
  # Name of alternative build module file to use if using an
  # unsupported platform. Is set automatically for supported machines.
  #
  # WFLOW_MOD_FN:
  # Name of alternative workflow module file to use if using an
  # unsupported platform. Is set automatically for supported machines.
  #
  # BUILD_VER_FN:
  # File name containing the version of the modules used for building the app.
  # Currently, WCOSS2 only uses this file.
  #
  # RUN_VER_FN:
  # File name containing the version of the modules used for running the app.
  # Currently, WCOSS2 only uses this file.
  #
  # SCHED:
  # The job scheduler to use (e.g. slurm).  Set this to an empty string in
  # order for the experiment generation script to set it depending on the
  # machine.
  #
  # PARTITION_DEFAULT:
  # If using the slurm job scheduler (i.e. if SCHED is set to "slurm"), 
  # the default partition to which to submit workflow tasks.  If a task 
  # does not have a specific variable that specifies the partition to which 
  # it will be submitted (e.g. PARTITION_HPSS, PARTITION_FCST; see below), 
  # it will be submitted to the partition specified by this variable.  If 
  # this is not set or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a 
  # machine-dependent value.  This is not used if SCHED is not set to 
  # "slurm".
  #
  # QUEUE_DEFAULT:
  # The default queue or QOS (if using the slurm job scheduler, where QOS
  # is Quality of Service) to which workflow tasks are submitted.  If a 
  # task does not have a specific variable that specifies the queue to which 
  # it will be submitted (e.g. QUEUE_HPSS, QUEUE_FCST; see below), it will 
  # be submitted to the queue specified by this variable.  If this is not 
  # set or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-
  # dependent value.
  #
  # PARTITION_HPSS:
  # If using the slurm job scheduler (i.e. if SCHED is set to "slurm"), 
  # the partition to which the tasks that get or create links to external 
  # model files [which are needed to generate initial conditions (ICs) and 
  # lateral boundary conditions (LBCs)] are submitted.  If this is not set 
  # or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent 
  # value.  This is not used if SCHED is not set to "slurm".
  #
  # QUEUE_HPSS:
  # The queue or QOS to which the tasks that get or create links to external 
  # model files [which are needed to generate initial conditions (ICs) and 
  # lateral boundary conditions (LBCs)] are submitted.  If this is not set 
  # or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent 
  # value.
  #
  # PARTITION_FCST:
  # If using the slurm job scheduler (i.e. if SCHED is set to "slurm"), 
  # the partition to which the task that runs forecasts is submitted.  If 
  # this is not set or set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a 
  # machine-dependent value.  This is not used if SCHED is not set to 
  # "slurm".
  #
  # QUEUE_FCST:
  # The queue or QOS to which the task that runs a forecast is submitted.  
  # If this is not set or set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a 
  # machine-dependent value.
  #
  # REMOVE_MEMORY:
  # Boolean flag determining whether to remove the memory flag for the
  # Rocoto XML. Some platforms are not configured to accept the memory
  # flag, so must not be included at all in the XML.

  # Set GRID_GEN_METHOD.  This variable specifies the method to use to 
  # generate a regional grid in the horizontal.  The values that it can 
  # take on are:
  #
  # * "GFDLgrid":
  #   This setting will generate a regional grid by first generating a 
  #   "parent" global cubed-sphere grid and then taking a portion of tile
  #   6 of that global grid -- referred to in the grid generation scripts
  #   as "tile 7" even though it doesn't correspond to a complete tile --
  #   and using it as the regional grid.  Note that the forecast is run on
  #   only on the regional grid (i.e. tile 7, not tiles 1 through 6).
  #
  # * "ESGgrid":
  #   This will generate a regional grid using the map projection developed
  #   by Jim Purser of EMC.
  #
  # Note that:
  #
  # 1) If the experiment is using one of the predefined grids (i.e. if 
  #    PREDEF_GRID_NAME is set to the name of one of the valid predefined 
  #    grids), then GRID_GEN_METHOD will be reset to the value of 
  #    GRID_GEN_METHOD for that grid.  This will happen regardless of 
  #    whether or not GRID_GEN_METHOD is assigned a value in the user-
  #    specified experiment configuration file, i.e. any value it may be
  #    assigned in the experiment configuration file will be overwritten.
  #
  # 2) If the experiment is not using one of the predefined grids (i.e. if 
  #    PREDEF_GRID_NAME is set to a null string), then GRID_GEN_METHOD must 
  #    be set in the experiment configuration file.  Otherwise, it will 
  #    remain set to a null string, and the experiment generation will 
  #    fail because the generation scripts check to ensure that it is set 
  #    to a non-empty string before creating the experiment directory.

  GRID_GEN_METHOD: ""
  #
  #-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # Set PREDEF_GRID_NAME.  This parameter specifies a predefined regional
  # grid, as follows:
  #
  # * If PREDEF_GRID_NAME is set to a valid predefined grid name, the grid 
  #   generation method GRID_GEN_METHOD, the (native) grid parameters, and 
  #   the write-component grid parameters are set to predefined values for 
  #   the specified grid, overwriting any settings of these parameters in 
  #   the user-specified experiment configuration file.  In addition, if 
  #   the time step DT_ATMOS and the computational parameters LAYOUT_X, 
  #   LAYOUT_Y, and BLOCKSIZE are not specified in that configuration file, 
  #   they are also set to predefined values for the specified grid.
  #
  # * If PREDEF_GRID_NAME is set to an empty string, it implies the user
  #   is providing the native grid parameters in the user-specified 
  #   experiment configuration file (EXPT_CONFIG_FN).  In this case, the 
  #   grid generation method GRID_GEN_METHOD, the native grid parameters, 
  #   and the write-component grid parameters as well as the time step 
  #   forecast model's main time step DT_ATMOS and the computational 
  #   parameters LAYOUT_X, LAYOUT_Y, and BLOCKSIZE must be set in that 
  #   configuration file; otherwise, the values of all of these parameters 
  #   in this default experiment configuration file will be used.
  #
  # Setting PREDEF_GRID_NAME provides a convenient method of specifying a
  # commonly used set of grid-dependent parameters.  The predefined grid

  # INCR_CYCL_FREQ:

  #
  # FCST_LEN_HRS:
  # The length of each forecast, in integer hours. The short forecast
  # length when there are different lengths.
  #
  # LONG_FCST_LEN_HRS:
  # The length of the longer forecast in integer hours in a system that
  # varies the length of the forecast by time of day forecasts for a
  # shorter period. There is no need for the user to update this value
  # directly, as it is derived from FCST_LEN_CYCL when FCST_LEN_HRS=-1
  #
  # FCST_LEN_CYCL:
  # The length of forecast for each cycle date in integer hours.
  # This is valid only when FCST_LEN_HRS = -1.
  # This pattern is recurred for all cycle dates.
  # Must have the same number of entries as cycles per day, or if less

  # Set PREEXISTING_DIR_METHOD.  This variable determines the method to use
  # use to deal with preexisting directories [e.g ones generated by previous
  # calls to the experiment generation script using the same experiment name
  # (EXPT_SUBDIR) as the current experiment].  This variable must be set to
  # one of "delete", "reuse", "rename", and "quit".  The resulting behavior for each
  # of these values is as follows:
  #
  # * "delete":
  #   The preexisting directory is deleted and a new directory (having the
  #   same name as the original preexisting directory) is created.
  #
  # * "rename":
  #   The preexisting directory is renamed and a new directory (having the
  #   same name as the original preexisting directory) is created.  The new
  #   name of the preexisting directory consists of its original name and
  #   the suffix "_oldNNN", where NNN is a 3-digit integer chosen to make
  #   the new name unique.
  #
  # * "reuse":
  #    If method is set to "reuse", 
  #     keep preexisting directory intact except that
  #     when preexisting directory is $EXPDIR, do the following:
  #       save all old files to a subdirecotry oldxxx/ and then
  #       populate new files into the $EXPDIR directory
  #    This is useful to keep ongoing runs uninterrupted:
  #     rocotoco *db files and previous cycles will stay and hence
  #       1. no need to manually cp/mv *db files and previous cycles back
  #       2. no need to manually restart related rocoto tasks failed during
  #            the workflow generation process
  #    This may best suit for incremental system reuses.
  #   
  #    Alternatively, one can always elect to use the "rename" option 
  #      and then manually do the above aftermath
  #
  # * "quit":
  #   The preexisting directory is left unchanged, but execution of the
  #   currently running script is terminated.  In this case, the preexisting
  #   directory must be dealt with manually before rerunning the script.

  #
  # ESGgrid_PAZI:
  # The rotational parameter for the ESG grid (in degrees).

  # In order to generate grid files containing halos that are 3-cell and
  # 4-cell wide and orography files with halos that are 0-cell and 3-cell
  # wide (all of which are required as inputs to the forecast model), the
  # grid and orography tasks first create files with halos around the regional
  # domain of width ESGgrid_WIDE_HALO_WIDTH cells.  These are first stored 
  # in files.  The files are then read in and "shaved" down to obtain grid
  # files with 3-cell-wide and 4-cell-wide halos and orography files with
  # 0-cell-wide (i.e. no halo) and 3-cell-wide halos.  For this reason, we
  # refer to the original halo that then gets shaved down as the "wide" 
  # halo, i.e. because it is wider than the 0-cell-wide, 3-cell-wide, and
  # 4-cell-wide halos that we will eventually end up with.  Note that the
  # grid and orography files with the wide halo are only needed as intermediates
  # in generating the files with 0-cell-, 3-cell-, and 4-cell-wide halos;
  # they are not needed by the forecast model.  
  # NOTE: Probably don't need to make ESGgrid_WIDE_HALO_WIDTH a user-specified 
  #       variable.  Just set it in the function set_gridparams_ESGgrid.py.
  #
  # Note that:
  #
  # 1) If the experiment is using one of the predefined grids (i.e. if

  #    grids), then:
  #
  #    a) If the value of GRID_GEN_METHOD for that grid is "GFDLgrid", then
  #       these parameters will not be used and thus do not need to be reset
  #       to non-empty strings.
  #
  #    b) If the value of GRID_GEN_METHOD for that grid is "ESGgrid", then
  #       these parameters will get reset to the values for that grid.  
  #       This will happen regardless of whether or not they are assigned 
  #       values in the user-specified experiment configuration file, i.e. 
  #       any values they may be assigned in the experiment configuration

  #   must be specified in order to define this parent global grid even 
  #   though the model equations are not integrated on (they are integrated
  #   only on the regional grid).
  #
  # * GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS is the number of grid cells in either one of the two 
  #   horizontal directions x and y on any one of the 6 tiles of the parent
  #   global cubed-sphere grid.  The mapping from GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS to a nominal
  #   resolution (grid cell size) for a uniform global grid (i.e. Schmidt
  #   stretch factor GFDLgrid_STRETCH_FAC set to 1) for several values of
  #   GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS is as follows:
  #
  #     GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS      typical cell size
  #     ------------      -----------------
  #              192                  50 km
  #              384                  25 km
  #              768                  13 km
  #             1152                 8.5 km
  #             3072                 3.2 km
  #
  #   Note that these are only typical cell sizes.  The actual cell size on
  #   the global grid tiles varies somewhat as we move across a tile.
  #
  # * Tile 6 has arbitrarily been chosen as the tile to use to orient the
  #   global parent grid on the sphere (Earth).  This is done by specifying 
  #   GFDLgrid_LON_T6_CTR and GFDLgrid_LAT_T6_CTR, which are the longitude
  #   and latitude (in degrees) of the center of tile 6.
  #
  # * Setting the Schmidt stretching factor GFDLgrid_STRETCH_FAC to a value
  #   greater than 1 shrinks tile 6, while setting it to a value less than 
  #   1 (but still greater than 0) expands it.  The remaining 5 tiles change
  #   shape as necessary to maintain global coverage of the grid.
  #
  # * The cell size on a given global tile depends on both GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS and
  #   GFDLgrid_STRETCH_FAC (since changing GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS changes the number
  #   of cells in the tile, and changing GFDLgrid_STRETCH_FAC modifies the
  #   shape and size of the tile).
  #
  # * The regional grid is embedded within tile 6 (i.e. it doesn't extend
  #   beyond the boundary of tile 6).  Its exact location within tile 6 is
  #   is determined by specifying the starting and ending i and j indices
  #   of the regional grid on tile 6, where i is the grid index in the x
  #   direction and j is the grid index in the y direction.  These indices
  #   are stored in the variables 
  #
  #     GFDLgrid_ISTART_OF_RGNL_DOM_ON_T6G
  #     GFDLgrid_JSTART_OF_RGNL_DOM_ON_T6G
  #     GFDLgrid_IEND_OF_RGNL_DOM_ON_T6G
  #     GFDLgrid_JEND_OF_RGNL_DOM_ON_T6G
  #
  # * In the forecast model code and in the experiment generation and workflow
  #   scripts, for convenience the regional grid is denoted as "tile 7" even
  #   though it doesn't map back to one of the 6 faces of the cube from 
  #   which the parent global grid is generated (it maps back to only a 
  #   subregion on face 6 since it is wholly confined within tile 6).  Tile
  #   6 may be referred to as the "parent" tile of the regional grid.
  #
  # * GFDLgrid_REFINE_RATIO is the refinement ratio of the regional grid 
  #   (tile 7) with respect to the grid on its parent tile (tile 6), i.e.
  #   it is the number of grid cells along the boundary of the regional grid
  #   that abut one cell on tile 6.  Thus, the cell size on the regional 
  #   grid depends not only on GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS and GFDLgrid_STRETCH_FAC (because
  #   the cell size on tile 6 depends on these two parameters) but also on 
  #   GFDLgrid_REFINE_RATIO.  Note that as on the tiles of the global grid, 
  #   the cell size on the regional grid is not uniform but varies as we 
  #   move across the grid.
  #
  # Definitions of parameters that need to be specified when GRID_GEN_METHOD
  # is set to "GFDLgrid":
  #
  # GFDLgrid_LON_T6_CTR:
  # Longitude of the center of tile 6 (in degrees).
  #
  # GFDLgrid_LAT_T6_CTR:
  # Latitude of the center of tile 6 (in degrees).
  #
  # GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS:
  # Number of points in each of the two horizontal directions (x and y) on
  # each tile of the parent global grid.  Note that the name of this parameter
  # is really a misnomer because although it has the string "RES" (for 
  # "resolution") in its name, it specifies number of grid cells, not grid
  # size (in say meters or kilometers).  However, we keep this name in order
  # to remain consistent with the usage of the word "resolution" in the 
  # global forecast model and other auxiliary codes.
  #
  # GFDLgrid_STRETCH_FAC:
  # Stretching factor used in the Schmidt transformation applied to the
  # parent cubed-sphere grid.
  #
  # GFDLgrid_REFINE_RATIO:
  # Cell refinement ratio for the regional grid, i.e. the number of cells
  # in either the x or y direction on the regional grid (tile 7) that abut
  # one cell on its parent tile (tile 6).
  #
  # GFDLgrid_ISTART_OF_RGNL_DOM_ON_T6G:
  # i-index on tile 6 at which the regional grid (tile 7) starts.
  #
  # GFDLgrid_IEND_OF_RGNL_DOM_ON_T6G:
  # i-index on tile 6 at which the regional grid (tile 7) ends.
  #
  # GFDLgrid_JSTART_OF_RGNL_DOM_ON_T6G:
  # j-index on tile 6 at which the regional grid (tile 7) starts.
  #
  # GFDLgrid_JEND_OF_RGNL_DOM_ON_T6G:
  # j-index on tile 6 at which the regional grid (tile 7) ends.
  #
  # GFDLgrid_USE_NUM_CELLS_IN_FILENAMES:
  # Flag that determines the file naming convention to use for grid, orography,
  # and surface climatology files (or, if using pregenerated files, the
  # naming convention that was used to name these files).  These files 
  # usually start with the string "C${RES}_", where RES is an integer.
  # In the global forecast model, RES is the number of points in each of
  # the two horizontal directions (x and y) on each tile of the global grid
  # (defined here as GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS).  If this flag is set to true, RES will
  # be set to GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS just as in the global forecast model.  If it is
  # set to false, we calculate (in the grid generation task) an "equivalent
  # global uniform cubed-sphere resolution" -- call it RES_EQUIV -- and 
  # then set RES equal to it.  RES_EQUIV is the number of grid points in 
  # each of the x and y directions on each tile that a global UNIFORM (i.e. 
  # stretch factor of 1) cubed-sphere grid would have to have in order to
  # have the same average grid size as the regional grid.  This is a more
  # useful indicator of the grid size because it takes into account the 
  # effects of GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS, GFDLgrid_STRETCH_FAC, and GFDLgrid_REFINE_RATIO
  # in determining the regional grid's typical grid size, whereas simply
  # setting RES to GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS doesn't take into account the effects of
  # GFDLgrid_STRETCH_FAC and GFDLgrid_REFINE_RATIO on the regional grid's
  # resolution.  Nevertheless, some users still prefer to use GFDLgrid_NUM_CELLS
  # in the file names, so we allow for that here by setting this flag to
  # true.
  #
  # Note that:
  #
  # 1) If the experiment is using one of the predefined grids (i.e. if 
  #    PREDEF_GRID_NAME is set to the name of one of the valid predefined
  #    grids), then:
  #
  #    a) If the value of GRID_GEN_METHOD for that grid is "GFDLgrid", then
  #       these parameters will get reset to the values for that grid.  
  #       This will happen regardless of whether or not they are assigned 
  #       values in the user-specified experiment configuration file, i.e. 
  #       any values they may be assigned in the experiment configuration 
  #       file will be overwritten.
  #
  #    b) If the value of GRID_GEN_METHOD for that grid is "ESGgrid", then
  #       these parameters will not be used and thus do not need to be reset
  #       to non-empty strings.
  #
  # 2) If the experiment is not using one of the predefined grids (i.e. if 
  #    PREDEF_GRID_NAME is set to a null string), then:
  #
  #    a) If GRID_GEN_METHOD is set to "GFDLgrid" in the user-specified 
  #       experiment configuration file, then these parameters must be set
  #       in that configuration file.
  #
  #    b) If GRID_GEN_METHOD is set to "ESGgrid" in the user-specified 
  #       experiment configuration file, then these parameters will not be 
  #       used and thus do not need to be reset to non-empty strings.

  # the write component, so users should not change the default value. 
  #
  # PRINT_ESMF:
  # Flag for whether or not to output extra (debugging) information from
  # ESMF routines. Must be true or false. Note that the write
  # component uses ESMF library routines to interpolate from the native

  # Sets the type (coordinate system) of the write component grid. The 
  # default empty string forces the user to set a valid value for 
  # WRTCMP_output_grid in config.yaml if specifying a *custom* grid. When 
  # creating an experiment with a user-defined grid, this parameter must
