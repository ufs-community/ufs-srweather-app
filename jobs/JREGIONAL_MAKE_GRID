#
# This script generates grid and orography files in NetCDF format that
# are required as inputs for running the FV3-LAM model (i.e. the FV3 mo-
# del on a regional domain).  It in turn calls three other scripts whose
# file names are specified in the variables grid_gen_scr, orog_gen_scr,
# and orog_fltr_scr and then calls the executable defined in the varia-
# ble shave_exec.  These scripts/executable perform the following tasks:
#
# 1) grid_gen_scr:
#
#    This script generates grid files that will be used by subsequent
#    preprocessing steps.  It places its output in the directory defined 
#    by GRID_DIR.  Note that:
#
#    a) This script creates grid files for each of the 7 tiles of the
#       cubed sphere grid (where tiles 1 through 6 cover the globe, and
#       tile 7 is the regional grid located somewhere within tile 6)
#       even though the forecast will be performed only on tile 7.
#
#    b) The tile 7 grid file that this script creates includes a halo,
#       i.e. a layer of cells beyond the boundary of tile 7).  The width
#       of this halo (i.e. the number of cells in the halo in the direc-
#       tion perpendicular to the boundary of the tile) must be made
#       large enough such that the "shave" steps later below (which take
#       this file as input and generate grid files with thinner halos)
#       have a wide enough starting halo to work with.  More specifical-
#       ly, the FV3-LAM model needs as inputs two grid files: one with a
#       halo that is 3 cells and another with a halo that is 4 cells 
#       wide.  Thus, the halo in the grid file that the grid_gen_scr 
#       script generates must be greater than 4 since otherwise, the
#       shave steps would shave off cells from within the interior of
#       tile 7.  We will let NHW denote the width of the halo in the
#       grid file generated by grid_gen_scr.  The "n" in this variable
#       name denotes number of cells, the "h" is used to indicate that
#       it refers to a halo region, the "w" is used to indicate that it
#       refers to a wide halo (i.e. wider than the 3-cell and 4-cell ha-
#       los that the FV3-LAM model requires as inputs, and the "T7" is
#       used to indicate that the cell count is on tile 7.
#
# 2) orog_gen_scr:
#
#    This script generates the orography file.  It places its output in
#    the directory defined by OROG_DIR.  Note that:
#
#    a) This script generates an orography file only on tile 7.
#
#    b) This orography file contains a halo of the same width (NHW)
#       as the grid file for tile 7 generated by the grid_gen_scr script
#       in the previous step.
#
# 3) orog_fltr_scr:
#
#    This script generates a filtered version of the orography file ge-
#    nerated by the script orog_gen_scr.  This script places its output
#    in the temporary directory defined in WORKDIR_FLTR.  Note that:
#
#    a) The filtered orography file generated by this script contains a
#       halo of the same width (NHW) as the (unfiltered) orography file
#       generated by script orog_gen_scr (and the grid file generated by 
#       grid_gen_scr).
#
#    b) In analogy with the input grid files, the FV3-LAM model needs as
#       input two (filtered) orography files -- one with no halo cells
#       and another with 3.  These are obtained later below by "shaving"
#       off layers of halo cells from the (filtered) orography file ge-
#       nerated in this step.
#
# 4) shave_exec:
#
#    This "shave" executable is called 4 times to generate 4 files from
#    the tile 7 grid file generated by grid_gen_scr and the tile 7 fil-
#    tered orography file generated by orog_fltr_scr (both of which have
#    a halo of width NHW cells).  The 4 output files are placed in the
#    temporary directory defined in WORKDIR_SHVE.  More specifically:
#
#    a) shave_exec is called to shave the halo in the tile 7 grid file
#       generated by grid_gen_scr down to a width of 3 cells and store
#       the result in a new grid file in WORKDIR_SHVE.
#
#    b) shave_exec is called to shave the halo in the tile 7 grid file
#       generated by grid_gen_scr down to a width of 4 cells and store
#       the result in a new grid file in WORKDIR_SHVE.
#
#    c) shave_exec is called to shave the halo in the tile 7 filtered
#       orography file generated by orog_fltr_scr down to a width of 0
#       cells (i.e. no halo) and store the result in a new filtered oro-
#       graphy file in WORKDIR_SHVE.
#
#    d) shave_exec is called to shave the halo in the tile 7 filtered
#       orography file generated by orog_fltr_scr down to a width of 4
#       cells and store the result in a new filtered orography file in
#       WORKDIR_SHVE.

# except the first one.  For this reason, we cannot use the <taskdep> 
# tag to make other cycle-dependent tasks depend on make_grid and must
# instead use a flag file.
