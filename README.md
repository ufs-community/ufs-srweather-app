This repository contains the regional workflow used to run the end-to-end UFS Short-Range Weather App.
This system includes pre-processing tasks, the regional UFS Weather Model, and the Unified Post Processor (UPP).
The workflow is a component of the UFS Short-Range Weather App umbrella repository.
